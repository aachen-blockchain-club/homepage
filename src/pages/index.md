              variety of coffee beans grown with great care for the environment and
              local communities. Check our post or contact us directly for current

              Love a great cup of coffee, but never knew how to make one? Bought a
              fancy new Chemex but have no clue how to use it? Don't worry, we’re here
              to help. You can schedule a custom 1-on-1 consultation with our baristas
              to learn anything you want to know about coffee roasting and brewing.
              Email us or call the store for details.

              We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
              That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
              space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
              coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
              sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.
